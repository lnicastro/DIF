1. Installation
---------------

We provide makefiles for the platforms Linux, OSF, Solaris, IRIX.
For Windows there is a Visual Studio Workspace file inculded.

Unix:
=====
To make things work, do

make PLATFORM
make

where PLATFORM is one of linux,osf,solaris,irix

and you'll have a working library in lib/ and a couple of example
apps in bin/.  All sources for the example executables are in app/ If
you want to build on a platform other than the four above, please edit
any of the Makefile.PLATFORM in src/ and app/, update it and save it
as Makefile.  Be so kind to send me a copy of that so that I can add
it to the distribution.

========
Load SpatialIndex.dsw in Visual Studio and build as usual.
There is a project for the dll as well as for all examples.
You might need to tweak some of the project settings..
